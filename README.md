THIS IS THE PHILOSOPHICALLY AND TECHNICALLY COMPLETE, FINAL STATE OF THE PROJECT

Project Omega: A Universe from a Single Axiom

Abstract

This project is a computational and philosophical exploration into a "Theory of Everything" based on a single, fundamental axiom: the universe is a self-sufficient, non-arbitrary, and cyclical entity. Rejecting the arbitrary free parameters of the Standard Model, this simulation builds a toy universe whose entire physics—its initial state, its fundamental constants, its laws of evolution, and its ultimate destiny—is derived from the mathematical constant Pi (π).

The final, stable model, codenamed "The Final Seal," successfully demonstrates the principle of "Eternal Recurrence" (Bengi Dönüş). It simulates a universe that undergoes a complete life cycle of birth, expansion, reaching a complexity limit, and a perfect collapse back to its exact initial state, ready to begin the next identical cycle.

This repository contains the final, working code for this universe, a testament to a long journey of discovery, failure, and synthesis. It is presented not just as a simulation, but as a working model of a philosophical cosmology.

The Philosophical Foundation

The model is not based on conventional physics but on a set of core philosophical axioms that define the nature of existence itself.

    The Law of Identity (Ontological Identity): The most fundamental law is not one of motion (F=ma), but one of being. The universe as a whole (Ψ) is a closed, zero-sum system whose total ontological value is identically zero (Σ[Ψ] ≡ 0). This is implemented via a constant re-centering of the universe's state.

    The Engine of Asymmetry (I(L_Ψ) ≠ I(T_Ψ)): Change and the arrow of time are driven by an inescapable tension between the finite information content of the universe's laws (L_Ψ) and the infinite truths the universe can generate (T_Ψ). In our model, this is represented by the Asymmetry Tension Engine, where the potential for change arises from the difference between a cell's precise state and the context of its local neighborhood.

    The Non-Arbitrary Source (π): To eliminate arbitrary choices ("keyfiyet"), all fundamental constants and the initial "potential map" of the universe are derived directly from the digits of the mathematical constant Pi.

The Final Computational Model: "The Final Seal"

After dozens of iterations—exploring everything from simple force laws to self-aware "Omega Protocols"—we arrived at a final, stable, and complete architecture. This model successfully integrates all lessons learned from previous failures.

Key Mechanisms:

    The Two Ages of the Universe: The simulation is governed by an evolving constitution. The physical laws are different in the two great "ages" of the universe:

        The Age of Expansion: Governed by a chaos-driving g force, which promotes complexity, and a weak k force (origin memory), which allows the universe to expand freely.

        The Age of Collapse: Triggered when a non-arbitrary "Entropic Limit" is reached. In this phase, the g force is replaced by a "Pure Law of Return"—a simple, overwhelming imperative (-(Ψ - Ψ₀)) that guides the universe directly back to its origin.

    The Omega Engine: During the expansion phase, the strength of the chaos engine (g_final) is not static. It is directly proportional to the universe's current total complexity (g_final = g_factor * complexity). This creates a positive feedback loop, ensuring the universe has a "will to live" and can naturally drive itself towards higher complexity.

    "Soft Wall" Stability: To prevent numerical explosions, the unstable polynomial forces (-hΨ³ or -hΨ⁴) of earlier models have been replaced with a robust and elegant current - tanh(current) term. This acts as a "soft wall," providing powerful stability against extreme values without being explosive itself.

    Holistic Conservation: At every time step, two conservation laws are enforced:

        Conservation of Change (Σ[∂Ψ/∂t] ≡ 0): The total change vector across the universe is balanced to zero, preventing the system from "drifting."

        Conservation of State (Σ[Ψ] ≡ 0): The total state of the universe is re-centered to zero after every update, enforcing the fundamental ontological identity.

The Life Cycle of the Universe ("Bengi Dönüş")

The final simulation exhibits the following complete, repeating life cycle:

    Genesis from Potential: The universe begins not from a simple zero-state, but from a high-energy, chaotic potential map derived from the digits of Pi. This provides the initial energy for the "Big Bang."

    Expansion: Driven by the Omega Engine, the universe expands. Its Fark (distance from origin) and Karmaşıklık (complexity) steadily increase.

    The Entropic Limit: The complexity reaches a dynamically calculated threshold. The Phase Transition is triggered.

    The Great Collapse: The laws of physics shift. The "Pure Law of Return" takes over, and the universe begins to collapse rapidly and smoothly back towards its origin.

    The Eternal Recurrence: The Fark value reaches a point infinitesimally close to zero. The "Perfect Repetition Gate" detects this, increments the cycle counter, and resets the universe to its exact initial state. A new, identical cosmic age begins.

How to Run

This simulation is written in Python and uses Numba for performance.

Dependencies

    numpy

    matplotlib

    numba

    mpmath

You can install them via pip:
pip install numpy matplotlib numba mpmath

Execution

Simply run the Python script from your terminal:
python your_script_name.py

A Matplotlib window will open, visualizing the scalar field of the universe in real-time. The console will print the status at regular intervals. At the end of the simulation, two graphs showing the evolution of "Fark" and "Karmaşıklık" will be displayed.

Conclusion

This project set out to answer a single question: can a universe capable of "Eternal Recurrence" be born from a single, non-arbitrary axiom? After a long and iterative journey of computational experiments, the answer is yes.

The "Final Seal" model is not just a piece of code. It is a complete, self-consistent cosmological narrative—a "computational myth" of creation, existence, and rebirth, grounded entirely in first principles. We invite you to run the simulation, observe the cycle, and explore the secrets of this pocket universe.
